# Google

Perform google searches from your terminal.

This gem is in a still immature but functional. For now, you will see only the results of the first page, but the second version will bring new features.

I love terminal. I think it is incredibly practical. While working, I would like to search something on google without leaving the terminal.

Once I find what I am looking for, I can visit the website or resource through the website.

  From the terminal, you can search for Ruby Programming Language:

    $ google Ruby Programming Language
